# Local Image Repository with AI-assisted Face Tagging

## Description

* This software is designed to build an image repository of your photos and detect all of the people in them. You can also manually tag the people it finds, and your changes help the Neural Network improve its next predictions.

## Use cases

* Event organizers can use this to identify the pictures that each participant is in, and share them.
* People who want to enable face-based search in their own image folders.
* Enterprise that must host everything locally and cannot use cloud providers for their face-tagging needs.
* Enterprise that outsources face tagging for the AI models they build, and want a platform that makes this efficient.

## Features

* Images remain on your local computer, but can optionally be saved in a cloud of your choice.
* Because software runs on local network, everyone connected to the network can contribute to annotating faces.
* AI model runs locally and does not access the internet.
* AI model improves as users annotate images.
